### New Courses

CS390 is a new course to be taken by students in the Game Design &amp;
Development concentrations within the Computer Science, Art, and Music majors.
Topics include interdisciplinary techniques of project management, version
control, integration and testing, platform-specific constraints, market
concerns, and how to form a business and manage intellectual property. Students
form interdisciplinary teams and build high-fidelity prototypes and production
plans. At the end of the semester, the projects are pitched to a board. Those
which pass become senior projects to be completed as CS490 or capstone courses.
